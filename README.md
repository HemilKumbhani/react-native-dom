# React-native-dom

An experimental, comprehensive port of React Native to the web.

* **Multithreaded by default:** Following the exact same architecture as React
  Native on mobile, all of your react components/app logic are run in web
  worker, leaving the main thread to entirely focus on rendering.
* **Same layout behavior as React Native on mobile:** Powered by custom bindings
  to Yoga and compiled to Web Assembly, avoid layout inconsistencies between
  your native and web projects.
* **Built with the same bundler used for existing React Native platforms:**
  Build both the "native" main and JS threads with the Metro Bundler along with
  all the developer experience features it provides.
* **Ecosystem compatible escape hatch to the DOM:** Using the same native module
  bridge, expose DOM-specific APIs in a more generic way that can easily be made
  into a cross-platform module.
